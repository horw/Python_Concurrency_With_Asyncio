# Python_Concurrency_With_Asyncio

I am a fresh graduate with good knowledge in python programm language.
For resent time I try to find job and faced a problem, every company need see your github in portgolio.
So will try fill this gap with some books and their pet projects and tasks.

Complete this book, clearly understand the benefit of asyncio, coroutines, multiprocessing. If you want to read this book "Python Concurrency With Asyncio" Matthew Fowler, I will strongly recommend do it!
